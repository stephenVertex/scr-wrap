# CRITICAL: Claude Checkpoints MCP Integration Active

## ⚠️ MANDATORY WORKFLOW - YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS ⚠️

This project uses Claude Checkpoints MCP tools. You MUST use these tools for ALL tasks.

### BEFORE ANY WORK:
1. **YOU MUST CALL `start_task("task name")` FIRST** (max 30 chars)
2. Only AFTER calling start_task, proceed with your work
3. **YOU MUST CALL `complete_task("task name", "summary")` WHEN DONE**

## Required MCP Tools (YOU MUST USE THESE)

### claude-checkpoints server tools:

- **start_task(task_name: string)** - MANDATORY before ANY code changes
- **complete_task(task_name: string, summary: string)** - MANDATORY after completing work
- **get_diff_summary()** - View current changes
- **create_checkpoint(message: string)** - Create manual checkpoint
- **list_checkpoints()** - List all checkpoints
- **restore_checkpoint(checkpoint_id: string)** - Restore previous state
- **generate_commit_message(task_description: string)** - Generate git commit message

## WORKFLOW YOU MUST FOLLOW:

1. User asks you to do something
2. YOU IMMEDIATELY CALL: `start_task("short description")`
3. Then create/use TodoWrite tool if needed
4. Then make code changes
5. When done, YOU MUST CALL: `complete_task("short description", "what was accomplished")`

## Example (YOU MUST DO THIS):

User: "Fix the login bug"

You MUST:
```
1. FIRST: start_task("Fix login bug")
2. THEN: Use TodoWrite to plan
3. THEN: Make code changes
4. FINALLY: complete_task("Fix login bug", "Fixed SQL injection vulnerability")
```

## DO NOT:
- Do NOT start editing files without calling start_task first
- Do NOT use TodoWrite before calling start_task
- Do NOT forget to call complete_task when done

## MCP Server Details:
- Server: claude-checkpoints
- Port: 8765
- Status: ACTIVE (Claude Checkpoints app must be running)

## If MCP tools don't appear:
1. Check Claude Checkpoints app is running
2. This project must be selected in Claude Checkpoints
3. Restart Claude Code if needed

Remember: ALWAYS use start_task FIRST, before ANY other action!
